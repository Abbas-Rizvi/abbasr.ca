<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about it a little in my about page but I wanted to elaborate a
little bit more on what I actually am trying to accomplish through this site.</p>
<h3 id="essentially-i-created-this-site-for-three-main-reasons">Essentially I created this site for three main reasons:</h3>
<h4 id="reason-1-project-portfolio">Reason 1) Project Portfolio</h4>
<p>While github is useful for showing projects and code with readme files, I felt
that it would also be good to have them all up in another place as well for more
ease of reading and possibly online hosting.</p>
<h4 id="reason-2-hosting-own-services">Reason 2) Hosting own services</h4>
<p>Another big reason in creating a website is to host my own services. I&rsquo;ve
always wanted to do a lot more on the internet than just browse and I felt this
was a good step in becoming more independent on the internet.</p>
<p>I wanted to minimize my use of proprietary software and &ldquo;other peoples&rdquo; services
and having a website acts as a portal which allows me to host and access things
I&rsquo;m interested in like a small blog, git server, file server and even email.
Hosting these things gives me much more control over the way I interact with
these things and provides an open sandbox for expanding.</p>
<p>This brings me to the third reason:</p>
<h4 id="reason-3-post-my-own-content">Reason 3) Post my own content</h4>
<p>As someone who is interested in technology I have frequently come across other
peoples websites online where they share opinions, guides and just general
advice regarding different software. While I&rsquo;m not at that point yet, I want to
do my own part in this eco-system and talk about things I&rsquo;ve came across and
learned through working on different things.</p>
<h3 id="site-infrastructure">Site Infrastructure</h3>
<h4 id="website-design">Website Design</h4>
<p>After going through several previous renditions of a website on my own, I
decided to give a Static-Site Generator a try and thus used
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> for the creation of the site. I found that Hugo
provided a good balance between providing the user freedom over the design
while still being very convenient and deploying pages statically.</p>
<p>I was able to download a minimal theme and alter a couple of things to create a
website I am happy with. Additionally, I can also easily add new pages through
creating simple markdown files and have them render as static content pages.
These are also put into a list on the category page making blog posts easy to
create.</p>
<p>While other alternatives exist, I am confident that Hugo was a great choice in
the creation of the website.</p>
<h4 id="server">Server</h4>
<p>Since I wanted to do a little bit more with different services than just a
basic html site, I decided to host the site myself on a VPS.</p>
<p>I think found that this was a great choice as I was able to improve my Linux
skills working with a headless server, while also familiarizing myself with
how deployment works on servers (at a basic level). Through hosting the site I
learned about <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">nginx</a>, something I plan on using for any
other sites I create in the future.</p>
<p>Although this VPS solution does work, I want to move over to a fully
self-hosted solution so I can create a file server without dealing with any
bandwidth limits.</p>
