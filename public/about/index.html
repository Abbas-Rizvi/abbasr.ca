<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>My name is Abbas and I&rsquo;m an aspiring Software Engineer from Toronto.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m passionate about learning about computers and technology, both in the domain of software and hardware.
Through developing my skills I want to be able to create powerful, practical software applications which can better the lives of people.</p>
<p>I am a strong supporter of <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software">free software</a> and am commited to ensuring all my work remains free and fully open-source.</p>
<h2 id="skills-and-technologies">Skills and Technologies</h2>
<p>Some of the programming languages and software I am experienced with include:</p>
<table>

<p>I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge base and work on learning new skills.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-website">About This Website</h2>
<p>This website was created to act as a hub for all my activities online. Whether
that be new projects or blogs, I wanted a place to post content freely.</p>
<p>I created this site using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> with a modified version of
the <a href="https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin">XMin Theme</a>. I decided to take a more
minimilist approach, because I found that it was a good balance between
functionality and simplicity.</p>
<p>I plan to continue adding on to the site with new features such as an email and
git server, along with semi-regular blogs.</p>
