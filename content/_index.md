# Abbas Rizvi

Welcome to my Website!

My name is Abbas and I'm a Software Engineering student. I'm passionate about
learning and applying various software development tools to create powerful
applications.

I'm interested in a wide range of technologies and enjoy exploring and learning
about different topics. Read about some of the projects I created on the 
[projects](/projects) or take a look at the new series of [blogs](/blog) I'm
just starting.

This website is self-hosted and I plan to rollout a variety of services over
time both for myself and maybe even others. This website will forever be a work
in progress and I will continue to add things as I go along.

Darkmode coming soon
