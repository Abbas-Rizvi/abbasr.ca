## About This Website

This website was created to act as a hub for all my activities online. Whether
that be new projects or blogs, I wanted a place to post content freely.

I created this site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a modified version of
the [XMin Theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin). I decided to take a more
minimilist approach, because I found that it was a good balance between
functionality and simplicity.

I plan to continue adding on to the site with new features such as an email and
git server, along with semi-regular blogs.
